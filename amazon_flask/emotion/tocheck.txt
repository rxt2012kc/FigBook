The skirt half hits my mid knee which is perfect for work. This is a no wrinkle, cheerful dress with just the right sleeve. Th Princess seams give this knit shape and form. I really love it, it is a new favorite.I want to add that this is quite heavy with essentially 2 layers of knit forming the fabric. For me in Wisconsin this is a 3 season dress. However in a warmer state this might feel hot in the summer. I was surprised by the heft of the dress although it works for me.

It fits well and the garment is well made. As it is a simple design, it is a very versatile garment and she has taken it to wear on formal nights on a cruise, and to dinner matched with pearls. It travels well with no wrinkles and the advantage is it is washable.My wife really likes this dress. It fits well and the garment is well made.
