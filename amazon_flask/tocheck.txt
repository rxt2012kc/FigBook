{u'date': u'2017-8-24', u'review': u'Head First Java Programming is an excellent way to learn Java.I purchased a few other books on Java and have found this one to be the best by far. Unlike most texts on Java, it actually goes through and teaches the subject rather than just serving as a reference material. Another great feature of this book is that it does not assume you already know C++ like most other Java books I purchased and subsequently put down after reading a few chapters. This is a great book if you are new to object oriented programming and would like to learn Java without having to first learn C++ and/or object oriented programming principles as a prerequisite.', 'label': 1, u'stars': u'5.0', u'format': u'Kindle Edition'}
{u'date': u'2017-9-11', u'review': u"Unlike the other java programming books, this book conditions the reader to become familiar with object oriented techniques along with teaching java. Many of the concepts and tips translate easily to any programming languages. I'm about half way through and I am completely satisfied with this java programming the complete reference book. The tone and delivery of all the lessons are incredibly easy to understand and helpful. Compared to other java books, I am learning better and faster with this book. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn java programming.", 'label': 1, u'stars': u'5.0', u'format': u'Kindle Edition'}
{u'date': u'2017-8-13', u'review': u"Honestly, I've never seen any computer book this relatable. This book actually talks to you rather than just throwing technical terms at you. It takes you through the concepts with ample amount of examples and pictures. And sometimes, it kind of feels like a kids book with all the pictures and the font(comic sans, really?). Don't get me wrong it actually helps understand things way better. Definitely recommended for anyone who needs to start learning java programming.", 'label': 1, u'stars': u'5.0', u'format': u'Kindle Edition'}
{u'date': u'2017-9-11', u'review': u'This java book really helps you understand not only what is going on, but why you do things a certain way in programming. This is what sets it apart from some of the other good Java books.', 'label': 1, u'stars': u'4.0', u'format': u'Kindle Edition'}
